## Project Description

The intention of this project was for students to develop an app that displays information from an activity tracker so that a user can view their data. Data relating to user information and stats around activity, hydration, and sleep was provided in the project spec. We used test driven development to create a testing suite with both happy and sad path testing. We used these tests to guide our development. The Mocha framework and the Chai library were used to implement the testing. Technologies used included JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
